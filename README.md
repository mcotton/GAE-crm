## Customer Relationship Manager for Google App Engine ##

You will need to create an account Google App Engine.  Once you have an account you should open app.yaml and change the application name.  After that you can deploy it.  You must log in with your google account to see it.  I have the most paranoid settings on which will only allow the admin account to view it.
